## Research interests
---

### *Heterogeneous Architectures / eFPGA*  

- Designing custom primitives for the SPAR-2 Array Processor implemented in FPGA utilizing a processing in-memory architecture with memristive elements. 

### *Embedded Systems / IoT*

- Prototyped a consumer-facing module for interfacing with a car's OBD-II port to retrieve diagnostic information.  

- Helped develop an RTOS for the OBD-II module using industry-standard tools such as CCS. 

## Education
---

#### University of Arkansas  --- *2019 - 2023*
* (expected) B.S. Computer Engineering  
  - GPA: 4.0
  - Honor's Thesis: Custom Processing In-Memory BRAMs for the SPAR-2 Array Processor

## Selected Engineering Projects
---

### *RTOS Driven Autonomous Vehicle*

- Developed an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating around a track of reflective tape using two simple light sensors using an FPGA board. The system implemented a MicroBlaze SoC on the FPGA and utilized the FreeRTOS Kernel for scheduling.

### *Exploration of Rowhammering Techniques*

- Conducted a survey of various techniques for rowhammering and their implementation schemes, then produced a report on how a synthesis of new techniques may be capable of breaking some of the finalists in the NIST PQC Standardization Process by serving as the fault-injection mechanism.

### *Power Usage of AES Power Analysis Attack Mitigation Strategies*

- Analyzed the power usage characteristics of a michrontoller performing AES encryptions across a variety of AES implementations. These utilizations used many variations and combinations of masking and hiding techniques to improve their resiliency against power analysis attacks.

## Employment
---
### *University of Arkansas*
* Research / Teaching Assistant --- *Summer 2021 - Spring 2022, Fall 2022 - Spring 2023*

### *Phillips 66*
* IT Intern --- *Summer 2022*
  - Identified communication and reporting issues in diagnostic software and architected a holistic dashboarding solution for reporting these issues in third-party software. This solution provides a usable problem notification and identification mechanism to Analysts with non-technical backgrounds.
  - Implemented a stop-gap solution for catching these problems until the long-term solution is able to be implemented by the development teams.

## Selected Professional Activities
