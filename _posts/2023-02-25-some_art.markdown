Hello! I thought I would share one of the characters that I've drawn more recently (not actually so recently).  
  
I don't expect much of this blog will be art stuff, and will instead primarily be about some neat research findings or cool papers I run across. From time to time though, I may decide to share something related to my hobbies.
