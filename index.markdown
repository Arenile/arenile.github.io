# About Me
Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Ivris Raymond, 
an undergraduate student at the University of Arkansas studying computer engineering.
Since summer 2021 I've been conducting undergraduate research in the AESIR Lab under
the direction of Dr. Alex Nelson.  
  
In the early stages of my research I was working on an embedded system for use in 
vehicles. Since then, I have refocussed my work in next-generation computer architectures. At the moment, I'm primarily interested in heterogeneous architectures that make use of paradigms like PiM and new computational/memory elements such as memristors (ReRAM) or STT-RAM.  

In my freetime, I enjoy writing and drawing. I also program as a hobby from time to time on personal projects. I've posted some of my art on my blog linked below, so feel free to check it out if you're interested! Most of the drawings are characters from the stories I've written or helped write.
